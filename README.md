## GoogleCalendar

### Overview
Using React, TypeScript, and PostgreSQL, I attempted to create a clone of Google Calendar. While I focused primarily on mimicking its appearance, I also took on the challenge of integrating with a database for added functionality.  
*(概要: React TypeScript Postgressを用いて、Google Calendarを目コピしてみた。見た目の再現に力を入れて、余力でDBとの接続などにも挑戦。)*

### Operating Environment
Crafted with love on the latest version of Chrome. Although, it's likely to work decently across most modern browsers, some hiccup in the layout might occur in browsers like Safari. So, keep an eye out for any display quirks!
